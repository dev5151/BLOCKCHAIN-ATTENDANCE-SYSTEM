## Guidelines:
```
1. Do not ever directly push to master. Test it our on a different branch before you commit and push to master.
2. Preferably raise issues on the code if you find any, or else directly text on social media platforms.
3. If you mess up, reset to the latest working master and start again.
//Add more guidelines if you feel anything else is necessary.
```
